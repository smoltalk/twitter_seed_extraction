# twitter_seed_extraction
(For research purposes only) This bash shell script takes a pre-curated list of Twitter "seeds" and extracts basic information about the account using the python tool Twint

Before running this program you need to install Twint (a Python tool) and create a list of usernames you want to extract info about in a file called "user."
